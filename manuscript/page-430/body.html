spirit for that.  If the girl likes another man better, it is very fit

destroyed, or even wounded, by a circumstance of this sort."</p><p>"Yes, yes, I understand you.  But there is nothing at all of that
nature in the letter.  He does not give the least fling at Benwick;
does not so much as say, 'I wonder at it, I have a reason of my own for
wondering at it.'</p></div> </div>
