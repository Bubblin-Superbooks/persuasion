on this point, in her intercourse in Camden Place.  The sight of Mrs
Clay in such favour, and of Anne so overlooked, was a perpetual

has a very large acquaintance, has time to be vexed.</p><p>As Mr Elliot became known to her, she grew more charitable, or more
indifferent, towards the others.  His manners were an immediate

almost ready to exclaim, "Can this be Mr Elliot?" and could not
seriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man.</p></div> </div>
