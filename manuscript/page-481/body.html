circle; for as you went with Lady Dalrymple, you were in the seats of
grandeur, round the orchestra, of course."</p><p>"No, that was what I dreaded.  It would have been very unpleasant to me
in every respect.  But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses to be
farther off; and we were exceedingly well placed, that is, for hearing;
I must not say for seeing, because I appear to have seen very little."</p></div> </div>
