pleasure as she did, in the expectation and in the actual arrival of
the very person whose presence must really be interfering with her
prime object.  It was impossible but that Mrs Clay must hate the sight
of Mr Elliot; and yet she could assume a most obliging, placid look,
and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting
herself only half as much to Sir Walter as she would have done
otherwise.</p><p>To Anne herself it was most distressing to see Mr Elliot enter the

been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere, but
now she saw insincerity in everything.</p></div> </div>
