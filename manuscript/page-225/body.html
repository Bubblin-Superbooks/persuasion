but I believe about a year before he married Mary.  I wish she had
accepted him.  We should all have liked her a great deal better; and
papa and mamma always think it was her great friend Lady Russell's

bookish enough to please Lady Russell, and that therefore, she
persuaded Anne to refuse him."</p></div> </div>
