lady now staying with you, whom I have heard you mention, came to Bath
with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter as long ago as September (in short when
they first came themselves), and has been staying there ever since;
that she is a clever, insinuating, handsome woman, poor and plausible,

as general a surprise that Miss Elliot should be apparently, blind to
the danger."</p><p>Here Mrs Smith paused a moment; but Anne had not a word to say, and she

long before you returned to it; and Colonel Wallis had his eye upon
your father enough to be sensible of it, though he did not then visit
in Camden Place;</p></div> </div>
