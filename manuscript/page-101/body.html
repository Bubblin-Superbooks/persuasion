had all my own little concerns to arrange, books and music to divide,
and all my trunks to repack, from not having understood in time what

of a more trying nature: going to almost every house in the parish, as
a sort of take-leave.  I was told that they wished it.  But all these

one word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday."</p><p>"Did you go then?  I have made no enquiries, because I concluded you
must have been obliged to give up the party."</p></div> </div>
